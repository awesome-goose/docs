#### Principles

- Structs are first-class citizens
- Tags are also first-class citizens
- Favour declarative over imperative
- Define migrations, seeds, models, dtos, controllers, routes, services, middlewares, configs, the platform would invoke them
- Stick to Go idioms and conventions, native, built-in packages wherever possible
