Goose modules are affectionately called "Gosling". They are the building blocks of your Goose application, allowing you to organize your code into reusable components. Each module can contain its own models, controllers, routes, and other components.
[]: # Gooselets can be created using the Goose CLI, and they can be easily shared and reused across different applications. This modular approach allows you to build complex applications by composing smaller, focused modules, making your codebase more maintainable and scalable.
